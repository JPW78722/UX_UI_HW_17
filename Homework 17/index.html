        <p>Warehouse Billiard Bar was first born as Warehouse Saloon & Billiards in 1984 and is still in the hands of the original owner, a rarity in Austin these days. In 2015, we began to envision a new Warehouse: a lush billiard hall, a multi-faceted entertainment facility, and a just plain-old sitting back joint. 

            We spent the first half of 2016 remodeling, renovating and re-branding. At 11,000 square feet, Warehouse Billiard Bar has plenty of what’s hard to find in Austin these days: parking, air conditioning, and elbow room.
